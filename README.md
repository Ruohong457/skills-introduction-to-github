# Detecting Machine-Generated Text Across Granularity, Domains, and LLMs

This repository contains the code and (partial) data used in the master's thesis project completed at Tilburg University for the MSc in Data Science & Society.

## 📘 Project Overview

This project investigates the generalization capabilities of machine-generated text detectors under realistic distribution shifts. Specifically, it evaluates how detection models perform when:

- The **text granularity** varies (e.g., sentence, paragraph, document)
- The **content domain** shifts (e.g., academic, social media, fiction)
- The **source LLM** differs (e.g., ChatGPT, GPT-4.5, DeepSeek R1)

A multilingual approach was adopted, covering both English and Chinese datasets. A new benchmark, **AGT-2025**, is introduced to test robustness against unseen LLMs.

## ⚙️ Methods

Four transformer-based classifiers were fine-tuned and tested:

- `roberta-base` (English)
- `chinese-roberta-wwm-ext` (Chinese)
- `DistilBERT` (English lightweight baseline)
- `MacBERT` (Chinese-specific)
- `XLM-R` (Multilingual baseline)

Key techniques:

- Fine-tuning on human vs. LLM-generated text
- Mixed-granularity training for robustness
- Cross-domain and cross-LLM evaluation
- SHAP analysis for interpretability
- Custom benchmark dataset: **AGT-2025**

## 🧪 Evaluation

- Models were evaluated using **precision**, **recall**, **F1**, and **accuracy**
- Emphasis on **generalization**: unseen domains, granularities, and LLMs
- Key findings:
  - RoBERTa achieves F1 > 0.99 on GPT-4.5
  - All detectors fail to reliably detect DeepSeek R1 in Chinese (F1 < 0.30)
  - XLM-R shows better robustness in Chinese cross-LLM scenarios
